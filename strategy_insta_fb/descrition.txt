Description
I want to design a social media application which allows me to connect to my friends on all four social platforms
i.e. Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and Orkut (for example sake). Now I want that client should be able to tell the 
name of friend and desired platform â€“ then my application should connect to him transparently.
